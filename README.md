### Custom shortcuts
If you have retail games (or on an unsupported platform) you can add your own shortcuts files (.lnk / .uri) to the plugin games list.

To do this, go to `Settings -> Plugins -> GamesLauncher -> Open Custom Shortcuts Directory`

Place your shortcut in the opened directory and... That's it! You can now `Reload Plugin Data` to update your library.
